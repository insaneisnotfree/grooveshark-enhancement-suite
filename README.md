Will add more here eventually; quick overview:

**browsers/**: Browser specific implementations of the extension, usually centered around injecting a user script -- a combination of all *ges* files. Currently available for only Chrome, but could easily be extended to Firefox, Safari, and Opera.

**modules/**: Modules are pretty independent from the rest of the project, and have access to all the functions provided by the *ges* object. Each module is exported to the enhancement suite via an object attached to the *ges.modules.modules* object, providing a set of functions and variables for its execution. Here are a few particular attributes:

- **isEnabled** is a boolean that determines the modules default state (can be overidden if the user disabled the module in a previous session.)
- **style** is an object that takes a *css* string to assosciate with the modules and a *getValues* function. The getValues function should return an object that replaces template variables in the provided css: background-image:{{ iconURL }} -> { 'iconURL': $('someElement').css('background-image') }
- **setup** is called when the Grooveshark webpage is ready
- **construct** is called when the module is *enabled*
- **destruct** is called when the module is *disabled*

**control.js, ges.user.js, server.js**: Aren't used in the final product, but useful for development. Control.js ensures files are loaded in order, ges.user.js injects script files into the page, and server.js is a node.js server which hosts those files from localhost.

**ges files**: The implementation of the *ges* object:

- **ges_ui.js** allows for on the fly lightboxes, notices, and player buttons
- **ges_events.js** creates an event for when the Grooveshark page has loaded and allows for the subscription to *GS.player* events
- **ges_db.js** allows for easier localstorage usage; currently used to remember a modules enabled state
- **ges_styles.js** allows for the templatizing and loading of JavaScript string stylesheets
- **ges_modules.js** manages modules 
- **ges.js** actual implementation that brings everything together
